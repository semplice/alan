## Default alan configuration for Semplice.
## To modify the menu, copy this file to ~/.config/alan/tree.conf and start tweaking ;)

[Alan]
## This is the first section that alan-gentree will parse.
## Supported settings:
##   categories: Specifies the list of categories to parse and print.
##               A category is represented in this file with a section
##               that starts with cat: (e.g.: cat:extensions)
##
##               Categories which starts with @ are 'main' categories:
##               there will be not created a submenu that handles
##               category's extensions.
##
##               Categories which doesn't starts with @ are 'normal'
##               categories: a submenu will be created and it will
##               handle all category's extensions.
##
##               Categories called - are separators, and doesn't need
##               a relevant section on this file. 
##   enable_icons: Enables icon support in menu. Requires Openbox
##                 3.5.0+ and alan 0.4.0+

### CATEGORIES
##
## A category is, in Alan, an object that contains extensions.
## Normally it is a menu item under which the extensions are stored as
## another items. (Yeah, I know: this explanation is brain-fucking)
##
## Example:
## |   MAIN  MENU   |
## |   Category 1  >| Extension 1 >|
##                  | Extension 2 >|
##                  | Extension 3 >|
##
## A category may also be treated as a 'main' item: the menu item will
## not be created:
##
## |   MAIN  MENU   |
## |  Extension 1  >|
## |  Extension 2  >|
## |  Extension 3  >|
##
## Whatever type it is, a category object will handle these two
## settings:
##
##   name: The name of the category. On 'main' categories it should be
##         STOCK_NULL.
##   extensions: The list of extensions to handle.
##               An extension is represented in this file with a
##               section that starts with ext: (e.g.: ext:xdgmenu)
##
##               Extensions called - are separators, and doesn't need
##               a relevant section on this file. 
##
## If the category is not main, this option is also supported:
##   icon: The icon to use. The gtk stock icons are suppported, too.
##         If omitted, no icon is displayed.

[cat:one]
## First part of the main category:
##   apps: provides an easy way to startup popular programs like the
##         Web Browser and the Terminal Emulator
##   xdgmenu: Applications menu
##   places: Places menu
##   desktop: Workspaces menu
name = STOCK_NULL
extensions = apps - xdgmenu places - desktop

[cat:extensions]
##  'Extensions' submenu:
##   music: Music extension
icon = gtk-execute
name = STOCK_EXTENSIONS
extensions = exaile

[cat:two]
## Second part of the main category:
##  appearance: Appearance settings (GTK+ Theme, Wallpaper, etc)
##  about: 'About Semplice' shortcut
##  logout: Logout menu
name = STOCK_NULL
extensions = appearance - about - logout

### EXTENSIONS:
##
## An extension is, in Alan, an object that provides a dynamic service
## to the user: menus to launch applications, menus to control the
## music player, etc.
##
## Alan splits the extensions in two types: Virtual and Normal.
## A Virtual extension is handled directly by alan-gentree, and does
## not uses any extension package.
## The supported virtual extensions currently are:
##   __itemlist__: a list of launchable items
##   __menu__: an internal openbox menu id
##   __item__: a single launchable item
##
## A Normal extension is a python file that resiedes in
## /usr/share/alan/alan/ext
##
## Configuration variables vary from an extension to another, but some
## are shared by all:
##   ext: extension to use
##   name: name to use for extension
##   icon: icon to use. GTK+ stock items are recognized, too.
##         If omitted, no icon is displayed.
